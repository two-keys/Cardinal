    goals:
      - name: Subscriber Perks
        cost: 400
        markdown: |
          We'll add on-site benefits to sponsors, account-holders with recurring donations, that will not impact the directory meta-game(We will explicitly not give sponsors reduced bump timers, post timers, or prompt priority). 
      - name: Extra Themes
        cost: 500
        markdown: |
          The site will have semi-customizable themes, including but not limited to options for site-layout(background, header, post, and text) colors and chat-list(unread, ended, answered) colors.
      - name: Archive Checkbox
        cost: 600
        markdown: |
          A checkbox will be placed in the Chat Info screen which, when every participant of a chat has it checked, will allow the chat to be viewable by non participants.
      - name: Site Statistics
        cost: 680
        markdown: |
          You'll have access to a monthly post containing curated data regarding the popularity of fandoms, various tags, and other assorted site statistics.
      - name: Push Notifications
        cost: 720
        markdown: |
          You'll have the option to enable notifications to be sent to your device or browser when you've got new unread replies, regardless of whether you're currently on the site or not.
      - name: Logical Blacklisting
        cost: 850
        markdown: |
          The blacklist will be upgraded with logical operators and priority setting, allowing for combinations (i.e. - if this tag is present, allow this other tag to be shown. Otherwise, hide it) so that you can have more control than a tag either showing or not.
      - name: Desktop App
        cost: 1100
        markdown: |
          We'll give creating a desktop client a go. If that doesn't work out - CherpBot on Discord.

        cost: 1500
        markdown: |
          We'll give creating a mobile(except for Apple devices) client a go.
